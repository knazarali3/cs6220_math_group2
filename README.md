**Owner:** Michael Hu

**Model Fine-tuned:** https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct-bnb-4bit

**Branch Directory:**
* Training SAT: Files used to train QWEN on the initial SAT dataset, as well as files used to evaluate its initial performance.
* Defunct PACE Code: Code initially meant to perform inference on the trained model using PACE. Did not work.
* QWEN SAT Inference: Code meant to generate outputs for the SAT math dataset as well as the csv file containing said outputs. 
* QWEN Competition Math Inference: Code meant to generate outputs for the competition math dataset as well as the csv file containing said outputs.
