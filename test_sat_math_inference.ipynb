      "    ### Response:\n",
      "    <|end_of_text|><|begin_of_text|>:// The number of seeds from the 4 apples Steven has set aside is 4 apples * 6 seeds/apple = 24 seeds. The number of seeds from the 3 pears Steven has set aside is 3 pears * 2 seeds/pear = 6 seeds. The total number of seeds Steven has collected so far is 24 seeds (from apples) + 6 seeds (from pears) = 30 seeds. The total number of seeds Steven needs to collect to fulfill his assignment is 60 seeds. The number of seeds Steven still needs to collect is 60 seeds - 30 seeds = 30 seeds. Since Steven needs 3 more seeds to fulfill his assignment, he needs 30 seeds - 3 seeds = 27 more seeds. The number of seeds from the 9 grapes Steven has set aside is 9 grapes * (x seeds/grape), where x is the average number of seeds per grape. The total number of seeds Steven has collected from the 9 grapes is 9 grapes * x seeds/grape. The number of seeds Steven needs to collect from the remaining grapes is 27 seeds. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 9 grapes * x seeds/grape = 27 seeds. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 27 seeds / 9 grapes = 3 seeds/grape. Therefore, grapes average 3 seeds each.<|end_of_text|>\n",
